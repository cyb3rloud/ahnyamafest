This repository contains the notes and Ducky scripts during the AfricaHackon Nyamafest Hardware Hacking Demos. 
Find instructions to use the script inside the source files. If no instructions are given, feel free to convert the source file to a .bin, and it will be ready for use. 

Encoding the source files;
1. Use the online payload studio by Hak5 at https://payloadstudio.com/community/
2. Alternatively, use the Java encoder as we did in the demos. I have uploaded the encoder to this repo. Use the command java -jar encoder.jar -i payload.txt -o /media/yourusername/DUCKY/inject.bin to encode the script on the rubber ducky.
